# Max Profit: Intuition

This solution calculates the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling stock multiple times, given an array of stock prices. It uses a **sliding window approach** to track the prices and identify the optimal points for buying and selling, while maximizing profit.

## Step-by-Step Explanation:

### 1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - The variable `total_profit` is initialized to 0 and will store the accumulated profit from all transactions.
   - The variable `profit` is initialized to 0 and will track the current potential profit during each iteration.

   ```cpp
   int total_profit = 0;
   int profit = 0;
   ```

### 2. **Sliding Window Iteration**:
   - The algorithm uses a sliding window approach to traverse through the `prices` vector. Two pointers, `i` (buy price) and `j` (sell price), are used to track the window. 
   - Initially, both `i` and `j` point to the first element of the vector, and `j` is incremented in each iteration to check the next price.

   ```cpp
   for (auto i = prices.begin(), j = i; ++j != prices.end();)
   ```

### 3. **Identify Transactions and Update Profit**:
   - In each iteration, the algorithm checks whether the difference between the current sell price (`*j`) and the buy price (`*i`) results in a potential profit.
   - If the current difference `*j - *i` is smaller than the current `profit`, this suggests that we have found a better point to sell and we should close the previous transaction:
     - Add the `profit` from the previous transaction to the `total_profit`.
     - Update the buy point (`i`) to the current sell point (`j`) since this might present a better opportunity to buy at a lower price.
     - Reset `profit` to 0 to start tracking the next transaction.

   ```cpp
   if (*j - *i < profit) {
       i = j;
       total_profit += profit;
       profit = 0;
   }
   ```

   - Otherwise, the algorithm continues to calculate the profit for the current window and updates `profit` if the new potential profit is greater than the previous one.

   ```cpp
   else
       profit = std::max(profit, *j - *i);
   ```

### 4. **Return the Total Profit**:
   - After the iteration completes, the `total_profit` contains the sum of all profitable transactions.
   - The final result is returned by adding any remaining `profit` from the last transaction.

   ```cpp
   return total_profit + profit;
   ```

### 5. **Sliding Window Approach**:
   - This approach maintains a dynamic window over the stock prices, where `i` represents the current buy point and `j` represents the current sell point.
   - By comparing the potential profit of each window, the algorithm effectively finds the optimal points for each transaction.

## Key Insights:

- **Sliding Window**:  
  The solution uses a sliding window technique where `i` and `j` iterate through the stock prices. The window adjusts dynamically to find the optimal buy and sell points to maximize profit.

- **Profit Calculation**:  
  The `profit` variable tracks the potential profit in the current window, and the `total_profit` accumulates the profit from all successful transactions.

- **Edge Case Handling**:  
  - The algorithm handles cases where no profit can be made (e.g., when prices are always decreasing).
  - It also works for cases where prices are constantly increasing by ensuring the last potential profit is added to the total.

- **Time and Space Complexity**:
  - **Time Complexity**: The algorithm runs in **O(n)** time, where `n` is the number of stock prices, as it iterates through the list once using the sliding window.
  - **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is **O(1)** since only a constant amount of extra space is used.

## Final Thoughts:

This solution efficiently calculates the maximum profit using a sliding window approach. By dynamically adjusting the window to find the optimal buy and sell points, it ensures that the solution is optimal for a variety of stock price patterns. The approach is both time-efficient and space-efficient, making it suitable for large inputs.
