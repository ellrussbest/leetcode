# threeSum Solution: Intuition

This solution finds all unique triplets in a given list of integers `nums` that sum up to zero. It utilizes sorting and the two-pointer technique to efficiently find all combinations of triplets that satisfy the condition.

## Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Sort the Input Array**:
   - The input vector `nums` is sorted in ascending order. Sorting helps to efficiently find triplets and avoids counting duplicates.
   
   ```cpp
   std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
   ```

2. **Iterate Through the Array**:
   - A `for` loop is used to iterate through each element `i` in the sorted array. For each element, we treat it as the first element of the potential triplet.
   - We skip over duplicate elements to avoid considering the same triplet more than once. This is done by checking if the current element is the same as the previous one.

   ```cpp
   if (i != nums.begin() && *std::prev(i) == *i)
       continue;
   ```

3. **Two-Pointer Technique**:
   - For each element `i`, we use two additional pointers: `left` starting just after `i` and `right` starting from the end of the array.
   - We calculate the sum of the elements at the three pointers: `i`, `left`, and `right`.
   
   - If the sum equals zero, we have found a valid triplet, which is added to the result vector `res`.
   
   - To avoid duplicates, we move the `left` and `right` pointers inward until we find different elements after adding a valid triplet.

   ```cpp
   auto sum = *i + *left + *right;

   if (sum == 0) {
       res.emplace_back(std::vector<int>{*i, *left, *right});
       while (true) {
           auto prev = right++;
           if (right == nums.rend()) break;
           if (*right != *prev) break;
       }

       while (true) {
           auto prev = left++;
           if (left == nums.end()) break;
           if (*left != *prev) break;
       }
   } else if (sum > 0)
       ++right;
   else
       ++left;
   ```

4. **Return Result**:
   - The function returns the result vector `res`, which contains all unique triplets that sum to zero.

5. **Space and Time Complexity**:
   - **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is **O(n²)**, where `n` is the length of the input vector `nums`. Sorting the vector takes **O(n log n)**, and the two-pointer approach processes each element in the array **O(n)** times.
   - **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is **O(k)**, where `k` is the number of valid triplets found, as we store the results in the `res` vector.

## Key Insights:

- **Sorting**:
  - Sorting the input array ensures that we can skip over duplicate elements and also allows the two-pointer technique to work effectively.

- **Avoiding Duplicates**:
  - The solution uses two strategies to avoid duplicate triplets:
    - Skipping over duplicate elements of the first pointer (`i`).
    - Moving the `left` and `right` pointers to skip over duplicate elements after finding a valid triplet.

- **Two-Pointer Approach**:
  - The two-pointer technique helps to efficiently find the remaining two elements of the triplet once the first element is fixed. This reduces the complexity from **O(n³)** (brute-force) to **O(n²)**.

## Final Thoughts:

This solution efficiently finds all unique triplets that sum to zero in **O(n²)** time and **O(k)** space, where `k` is the number of valid triplets. The use of sorting and the two-pointer technique makes the solution both optimal and easy to understand. The handling of duplicates ensures that only unique triplets are returned, making the solution suitable for problems with multiple possible duplicate results.
