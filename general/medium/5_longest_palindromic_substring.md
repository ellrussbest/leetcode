# longestPalindrome Solution: Intuition

This solution finds the longest palindromic substring in a given string `s`. It uses the "expand around center" approach to find palindromes of both odd and even lengths. By iterating through each character in the string and expanding around it, we can efficiently find the longest palindrome in **O(n^2)** time with **O(1)** extra space.

## Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   We initialize `left` and `right` as iterators to the end of the string `s`. These will be used to store the boundaries of the longest palindrome found. We also initialize `max_len` to keep track of the length of the current longest palindrome.

   ```cpp
   auto right = s.end();
   auto left = s.end();
   long int max_len = 0;
   ```

2. **Iterate Through the String**:
   We loop through each character in the string, treating it as the center of a potential palindrome. For each character, we check for both odd-length and even-length palindromes by expanding around the center.

   ```cpp
   for (auto i = s.begin(); i != s.end(); ++i) {
       auto [odd_len, odd_left, odd_right] = expand_around_center(i, s);
       auto [even_len, even_left, even_right] = expand_around_center(i, s, true);
   ```

   - **Odd-Length Palindrome**: A palindrome with a single character in the center.
   - **Even-Length Palindrome**: A palindrome with two characters in the center.

3. **Update the Longest Palindrome**:
   For both the odd-length and even-length palindromes, if the length of the current palindrome is greater than `max_len`, we update `max_len` and set `left` and `right` to the boundaries of the current palindrome.

   ```cpp
   if (odd_len > max_len) {
       max_len = odd_len;
       left = odd_left;
       right = odd_right;
   }

   if (even_len > max_len) {
       max_len = even_len;
       left = even_left;
       right = even_right;
   }
   ```

4. **Return the Longest Palindrome**:
   After iterating through all the characters, we return the longest palindrome substring using the `left` and `right` iterators.

   ```cpp
   return {left, right};
   ```

## Helper Function: `expand_around_center`

The `expand_around_center` function is used to find the longest palindrome centered at a given character (or pair of characters for even-length palindromes). It takes an iterator `right` and the string `s` as inputs, and it returns a tuple containing:
   - The length of the palindrome,
   - The left iterator of the palindrome,
   - The right iterator of the palindrome.

```cpp
template <typename BidirIt>
std::tuple<long int, BidirIt, BidirIt> expand_around_center(
    BidirIt right, const std::string& s, bool is_even = false) {
    auto left = --std::make_reverse_iterator(right);
    if (is_even) ++right;

    while (left != s.rend() && right != s.end() && *left == *right) {
        ++left, ++right;
    }

    return {std::distance(left.base(), right), left.base(), right};
}
```

- **Odd-Length Palindrome**: If `is_even` is `false`, we start with `left = right`, and we expand outwards to check if the characters match.
- **Even-Length Palindrome**: If `is_even` is `true`, we start with `left = right - 1`, and we expand outward to check for matching characters.

## Key Insights:

- **Expand Around Center**: This approach is based on the idea that a palindrome mirrors around its center. By expanding outwards from each character (or pair of characters), we can efficiently find all palindromes.
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is **O(n^2)** because for each of the `n` characters, we expand outwards in both directions, which takes O(n) time for each expansion.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is **O(1)** as we only use a few variables to store the current longest palindrome and the iterators.

## longestPalindrome_bruteforce Solution: Intuition

The brute-force approach finds the longest palindromic substring by checking all possible substrings of the given string `s`. For each substring, we check if it is a palindrome, and if it is, we compare its length to the longest palindrome found so far.

## Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Helper Function: `is_palindrome`**:
   - The function `is_palindrome` checks if a given substring is a palindrome. It uses two pointers (`left` and `right`) to compare characters from both ends of the substring.

   ```cpp
   auto is_palindrome = [](const auto& substr) {
       auto left = substr.begin();
       auto right = substr.rbegin();

       while (left < right.base()) {
           if (*left != *right) return false;
           ++left, ++right;
       }

       return true;
   };
   ```

2. **Iterate Through All Substrings**:
   - We iterate over all possible starting indices `i` of substrings, and for each starting index, we iterate over all possible ending indices `j` of substrings.

   ```cpp
   for (size_t i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
       std::string substr{};
       for (size_t j = i; j < s.size(); ++j) {
           substr += s[j];
           if (is_palindrome(substr) && substr.size() > res.size()) {
               res = substr;
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   - For each substring, we check if it is a palindrome using the `is_palindrome` function.
   - If it is a palindrome and its length is greater than the current longest palindrome (`res`), we update `res` to the new substring.

3. **Return the Longest Palindrome**:
   After checking all substrings, we return the longest palindrome found.

   ```cpp
   return res;
   ```

## Key Insights:

- **Brute Force**: This approach generates all possible substrings and checks if each one is a palindrome. While straightforward, this method is inefficient for large strings.
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is **O(n^3)** because for each of the `n` starting indices, we generate `O(n)` substrings, and checking if each substring is a palindrome takes `O(n)` time.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is **O(n^2)** because we generate all substrings and store them in memory.

## Example Walkthrough:

Consider the input `s = "babad"`:

- **Brute Force**:
  - Substrings like `"b"`, `"ba"`, `"bab"`, and `"babad"` are checked.
  - The longest palindromic substring found is `"bab"` (or `"aba"`, both are valid).

- **Efficient Solution**:
  - The efficient `longestPalindrome` approach identifies `"bab"` as the longest palindrome by expanding around centers.

## Final Thoughts:

- **Efficient Solution**: The expand-around-center approach is an optimal solution for this problem, offering **O(n^2)** time complexity and **O(1)** space complexity.
- **Brute Force**: The brute-force approach is simple but inefficient with **O(n^3)** time complexity, making it unsuitable for larger strings.

This combination of a brute-force solution and an optimized approach provides a clear comparison between the two methods, with the efficient method being preferable for larger inputs.
