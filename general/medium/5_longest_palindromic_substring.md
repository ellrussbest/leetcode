# longestPalindrome Solution: Intuition

This solution solves the problem of finding the longest palindromic substring in a given string `s`. It uses the **expand around center** technique, which checks for palindromes by considering each character (and pair of characters) as a potential center. The algorithm expands outwards to see if the characters on both sides are equal, identifying palindromes of both odd and even lengths.

## Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   We initialize two iterators:
   - `first`: points to the beginning of the longest palindromic substring found.
   - `last`: points to the end of the longest palindromic substring found.

   ```cpp
   auto first = s.end();
   auto last = s.end();
   ```

2. **Iterate Over Each Character**:
   The algorithm iterates through each character of the string, treating it as the center of a potential palindrome. For each character, it checks for palindromes of both odd and even lengths using the `expand_around_center` function.

   ```cpp
   for (auto it = s.begin(); it != s.end(); ++it) {
       auto [odd_len, odd_start, odd_end] = expand_around_center(it, s);
       auto [even_len, even_start, even_end] = expand_around_center(it, s, true);
   ```

3. **Update the Longest Palindrome**:
   For each expansion, if the length of the found palindrome (either odd or even) is greater than the current longest palindrome, we update `first` and `last` to the starting and ending iterators of that palindrome.

   ```cpp
   if (odd_len > std::distance(first, last)) {
       first = odd_start;
       last = odd_end;
   }
   if (even_len > std::distance(first, last)) {
       first = even_start;
       last = even_end;
   }
   ```

4. **Return the Result**:
   After checking all possible centers, the substring between `first` and `last` represents the longest palindromic substring. We return it.

   ```cpp
   return {first, last};
   ```

## Helper Functions:

### expand_around_center

The `expand_around_center` function is a key part of the solution. It takes a center and expands outwards in both directions (left and right) to check if the substring is a palindrome. It works for both odd and even length palindromes. The function returns the length of the palindrome and the start and end iterators for the longest palindrome found from the given center.

#### Parameters:
- `center`: The center of the potential palindrome (an iterator pointing to the current character).
- `s`: The string in which we are searching for palindromes.
- `is_even` (optional): A boolean indicating whether we are looking for an even-length palindrome. The default is `false` (odd-length palindrome).

#### Logic:
1. We initialize two iterators, `left` and `right`, around the center.
2. If `is_even` is true, we adjust the `right` pointer to the next character to handle even-length palindromes.
3. We then expand the pointers outward while ensuring the characters at `left` and `right` are equal.
4. The function continues to expand until the characters differ or the pointers go out of bounds.

```cpp
template <typename BidirIt>
std::tuple<long int, BidirIt, BidirIt> 
expand_around_center(BidirIt center, const std::string& s, bool is_even = false) {
    auto& right = center;
    auto left = --std::make_reverse_iterator(right);
    if (is_even) ++right;

    while (left != s.rend() && right != s.end()) {
        if (*left != *right) break;
        ++left, ++right;
    }

    return {std::distance(left.base(), right), left.base(), right};
}
```

#### Return:
- **Length of palindrome**: `std::distance(left.base(), right)` gives the length of the palindrome.
- **Start and end iterators**: `left.base()` and `right` give the iterators for the start and end of the palindrome.

### is_palindrome

The `is_palindrome` function checks if a given substring is a palindrome. It works by iterating through the string from both ends and comparing the characters. If all the characters match, the substring is a palindrome.

#### Parameters:
- `first` and `last`: Bidirectional iterators pointing to the beginning and end of the substring.

#### Logic:
1. We iterate through the string from both ends using the iterators `first` and `last`.
2. If the characters at `first` and `last` don't match, the substring is not a palindrome, and we return `false`.
3. If all characters match, we return `true`.

```cpp
template <typename BidirIt>
bool is_palindrome(BidirIt first, BidirIt last) {
    while (first != last && first != --last)
        if (*first++ != *last) return false;
    return true;
}
```

## Key Insights:

- **Expand Around Center**:
  - The approach exploits the fact that a palindrome mirrors around its center. By expanding outwards from each center, we can efficiently find palindromes of both odd and even lengths.
  
- **Time Complexity**:
  - **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is **O(n^2)**, where `n` is the length of the string. For each character, we expand around it to check for palindromes, and expanding takes linear time.
  - **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is **O(1)**, as no additional space is required beyond a few variables.

---

## Final Thoughts:

The **expand around center** approach is efficient for finding palindromes, though it has a quadratic time complexity. For strings with moderate lengths, this approach works well. It is more efficient than brute-force methods but still has limitations for very large strings.

# longestPalindrome_bruteforce Solution: Intuition

This brute-force solution solves the same problem of finding the longest palindromic substring in a given string `s`. However, instead of expanding around a center, it checks all possible substrings and verifies if they are palindromes.

## Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Iterate Over All Substrings**:
   We use two nested loops to generate all possible substrings of `s`:
   - The outer loop (`i`) defines the starting index of the substring.
   - The inner loop (`j`) defines the ending index of the substring.

   For each pair of indices `(i, j)`, we extract the substring and check if it is a palindrome.

   ```cpp
   for (auto i = s.begin(); i != s.end(); ++i) {
       auto substr = std::string{};
       for (auto j = i; j != s.end(); ++j) {
           substr += *j;
           if (is_palindrome(substr.begin(), substr.end()) && substr.size() > res.size())
               res = substr;
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Check for Palindrome**:
   We use the helper function `is_palindrome` to check if the current substring (`substr`) is a palindrome.

   ```cpp
   if (is_palindrome(substr.begin(), substr.end()) && substr.size() > res.size())
       res = substr;
   ```

3. **Update Maximum Palindromic Substring**:
   If the current substring is a palindrome and its size is greater than the current result `res`, we update `res` to this new palindrome.

   ```cpp
   res = substr;
   ```

4. **Return the Result**:
   After checking all possible substrings, `res` will contain the longest palindromic substring.

   ```cpp
   return res;
   ```

## Key Insights:

- **Brute-Force Approach**:
  - The brute-force method generates all possible substrings and checks if each one is a palindrome. This approach is simple but inefficient compared to more advanced techniques like expanding around the center.

- **Time Complexity**:
  - **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is **O(n^3)** in the worst case, as we generate all substrings and for each one, we check if it is a palindrome (which takes linear time).
  - **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string, as we are storing substrings and the characters within them.

---

## Final Thoughts:

The brute-force approach works for small input sizes but is inefficient for larger strings. It generates all possible substrings and checks if each one is a palindrome, leading to a cubic time complexity. For larger inputs, the expand-around-center approach is preferred due to its **O(n^2)** time complexity.

---

## Example Walkthrough:

Consider the input string `s = "babad"`:

1. **Brute-Force Approach**:
   - Start with the substring `"b"`, `"ba"`, `"bab"`, and so on.
   - The longest palindrome found is `"bab"`, which has a length of `3`.

2. **Expand Around Center Approach**:
   - Start with the center at `"b"`, expand to find `"bab"`, then `"aba"`, and so on.
   - The longest palindrome found is `"bab"`, which has a length of `3`.

---

## Final Comparison:

- **Efficiency**: The expand-around-center solution is more efficient (`O(n^2)` time) compared to the brute-force solution (`O(n^3)`).
- **Memory Usage**: Both solutions use **O(1)** space, but the brute-force method uses more space to store substrings.
