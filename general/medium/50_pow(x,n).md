# Power Function: Intuition

This solution calculates `x` raised to the power of `n` (i.e., `x^n`). It uses the efficient method of **exponentiation by squaring** to minimize the number of multiplications. The function also handles edge cases, such as when `n` is negative or when `x` is 0 or 1.

## Step-by-Step Explanation:

### 1. **Handle Special Cases**:
   - The first condition handles the case when `n == 0`. According to the mathematical rule, any number raised to the power of 0 is 1, so the function immediately returns 1.
   
   ```cpp
   if (n == 0) return 1;
   ```

   - The second condition checks if `x` is either 1 or 0. If `x` is 1, any power of 1 will always be 1, so we can immediately return 1. Similarly, if `x` is 0, we return `x` (since `0^n = 0` for any non-zero `n`).
   
   ```cpp
   if (float_eq_to(x, 1) || float_eq_to(x, 0)) 
    return x;
   ```

### 2. **Handle Negative Exponent**:
   If `n` is negative, we adjust the base `x` and the exponent `n`. The property `x^-n = 1 / (x^n)` is used to convert the negative exponent into a positive exponent.
   
   - The variable `y` is used to store the absolute value of `n` (converted to `long` to avoid potential overflow with `int`).
   - We adjust `x` by setting `x = 1 / x` and take the absolute value of `n` (stored in `y`).

   ```cpp
   long y = n;
   if (n < 0) {
       x = 1 / x;
       y = std::abs(y);
   }
   ```

### 3. **Exponentiation by Squaring**:
   This is the core of the algorithm, where we use the **exponentiation by squaring** technique to compute `x^n` efficiently.

   - We initialize a variable `res` to 1, which will store the final result.
   - We loop through the binary representation of `y`. If `y` is odd (i.e., `y % 2 == 1`), we multiply `res` by `x`.
   - At each step, we square `x` (i.e., `x = x * x`) and halve `y` (i.e., `y = y / 2`), effectively reducing the number of multiplications logarithmically.
   
   ```cpp
   double res = 1;
   while (y) {
       if (y % 2 == 1) res *= x;
       x *= x;
       y /= 2;
   }
   ```

   - **Why exponentiation by squaring?**:  
     This approach works by leveraging the binary representation of the exponent. Instead of multiplying `x` by itself `n` times, we reduce the number of operations by squaring the base and halving the exponent at each step. This reduces the time complexity to **O(log n)**.

### 4. **Return the Result**:
   After the loop completes, `res` contains the value of `x^n`, which is returned.

   ```cpp
   return res;
   ```

### 5. **Floating-Point Comparison**:
   The function `float_eq_to` is a helper function used to compare floating-point values for equality. Due to the imprecision of floating-point arithmetic, the function checks if the difference between two floating-point numbers `x` and `y` is smaller than a very small threshold (`epsilon`), ensuring that the comparison is reliable.

   ```cpp
   bool float_eq_to(double x, double y) {
       if (std::fabs(x - y) < std::numeric_limits<double>::epsilon())
           return true;
       return false;
   }
   ```

   - `std::fabs(x - y)`: Calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y`.
   - `std::numeric_limits<double>::epsilon()`: Provides the smallest positive number that, when added to 1.0, results in a number distinguishable from 1.0. This is used to define the threshold for comparison.

## Key Insights:

- **Exponentiation by Squaring**:  
  The method of exponentiation by squaring efficiently computes powers in logarithmic time (**O(log n)**), making it significantly faster than iterating through all the multiplications for large values of `n`.
  
- **Negative Exponents**:  
  The function handles negative exponents by first converting them to positive exponents and adjusting the base accordingly (`x = 1 / x`).

- **Edge Case Handling**:
  - The solution correctly handles special cases like `x = 1`, `x = 0`, and `n = 0`.
  - The function uses a helper method to perform safe comparisons for floating-point values, ensuring accuracy when checking conditions for `x == 1` or `x == 0`.

- **Floating-Point Precision**:  
  Floating-point numbers may introduce precision issues, so the helper function `float_eq_to` ensures reliable equality checks for floating-point values, avoiding pitfalls due to small rounding errors.

- **Time and Space Complexity**:
  - **Time Complexity**: The algorithm runs in **O(log n)** time due to the exponentiation by squaring technique.
  - **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is **O(1)** since only a constant amount of extra space is used, irrespective of the size of `n`.

## Final Thoughts:

This solution efficiently computes `x^n` using the method of exponentiation by squaring. It handles edge cases such as when `n` is negative or when `x` is 0 or 1. The use of floating-point comparison ensures that the function works correctly in all cases without being affected by the precision issues typical of floating-point arithmetic. This approach is both time-efficient and space-efficient, making it ideal for large values of `n`.
