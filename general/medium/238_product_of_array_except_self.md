# Product Except Self Solution: Intuition

This solution computes the product of all the elements in an array except the element at the current index. The approach uses prefix and suffix product arrays to efficiently calculate the desired result without using division.

## Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - We create an empty vector `res` to store the final results.
   - Two additional vectors `prefix_product` and `suffix_product` are created to hold the cumulative product results from the start (prefix) and from the end (suffix) of the input array.

   ```cpp
   std::vector<int> res;
   std::vector<int> prefix_product;
   std::vector<int> suffix_product;
   ```

2. **Prefix Product Calculation**:
   - We use `std::partial_sum` with `std::multiplies<int>` to calculate the cumulative product of elements from the start (index `0`) to the current index. The result is stored in `prefix_product`.

   ```cpp
   std::partial_sum(nums.begin(), nums.end(), std::back_inserter(prefix_product), std::multiplies<int>{});
   ```

3. **Suffix Product Calculation**:
   - Similarly, `std::partial_sum` is used in reverse order (using `rbegin()` and `rend()`) to calculate the cumulative product from the end (index `n-1`) to the current index. This result is stored in `suffix_product`.

   ```cpp
   std::partial_sum(nums.rbegin(), nums.rend(), std::back_inserter(suffix_product), std::multiplies<int>{});
   ```

4. **Compute Final Product**:
   - For each index `i`, we calculate the product of the prefix and suffix values at that index. This ensures that the final product for index `i` excludes the value at `i`.

   ```cpp
   for (int i = 0; i < static_cast<int>(nums.size()); ++i) {
       auto product = prefix(prefix_product, i) * suffix(suffix_product, i);
       res.emplace_back(std::move(product));
   }
   ```

5. **Return Result**:
   - After the loop completes, the result vector `res` is returned containing the desired products.

   ```cpp
   return res;
   ```

6. **Helper Functions**:
   - **Suffix Function**: Returns the cumulative product of elements to the right of the current index, or `1` if there are no elements.
   - **Prefix Function**: Returns the cumulative product of elements to the left of the current index, or `1` if there are no elements.

   ```cpp
   int suffix(const std::vector<int>& suffix_product, int idx);
   int prefix(const std::vector<int>& prefix_product, int idx);
   ```

7. **Space and Time Complexity**:
   - **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is **O(n)** because we perform a constant-time operation for each element in the array: two passes for calculating the prefix and suffix products and another pass to compute the result.
   - **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is **O(n)** because we store both prefix and suffix products, as well as the result vector.

## Key Insights:

- **Efficient Product Calculation**:
  - Using `std::partial_sum` with `std::multiplies<int>` efficiently calculates the prefix and suffix products in linear time, making the solution scalable.
  
- **No Division**:
  - Unlike traditional solutions that use division, this method avoids division by relying on prefix and suffix product arrays, which ensures that the product calculation is accurate for all elements in the array.
  
- **Helper Functions for Clarity**:
  - The `prefix` and `suffix` functions abstract the logic for fetching the correct product for each index, making the main loop more readable.

## Final Thoughts:

This solution efficiently computes the product of all elements except the one at the current index in **O(n)** time and **O(n)** space. It avoids the use of division, which is a common pitfall in similar problems. The use of prefix and suffix products ensures that we can compute the result in a simple and clear manner.
