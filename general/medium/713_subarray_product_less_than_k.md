# `numSubarrayProductLessThanK` Solution: Intuition

This solution calculates the number of contiguous subarrays whose product is less than a given value `k`. We use a sliding window approach to efficiently find subarrays without recomputing the product for every possible subarray. 

## Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - We start by checking if `k` is 0. If it is, the result is immediately 0, as no subarray can have a product less than 0.
   - We initialize two variables: 
     - `count` to track the number of valid subarrays.
     - `product` to store the current product of elements in the current subarray.

   ```cpp
   if (k == 0)
       return 0;

   int count = 0;
   int product = 1;
   ```

2. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - We use two pointers, `i` and `j`, to represent the sliding window.
   - We iterate through the array using `j` (the right pointer) and expand the window by multiplying the `product` with `nums[j]`.
   - Whenever the `product` exceeds or equals `k`, we increment the left pointer `i` to shrink the window, dividing the `product` by `nums[i]` until the product is less than `k`.
   - For each position of `j`, the number of subarrays ending at `j` is `(j - i + 1)`.

   ```cpp
   for (size_t i = 0, j = 0; j < nums.size(); ++j) {
       product *= nums[j];

       while (i <= j && product >= k)
           product /= nums[i++];
       
       count += static_cast<int>(j - i) + 1;
   }
   ```

3. **Return Result**:
   - After processing the entire array, the `count` will contain the total number of subarrays whose product is less than `k`.

   ```cpp
   return count;
   ```

4. **Space and Time Complexity**:
   - **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is **O(n)** where `n` is the number of elements in the `nums` array. This is because each element is processed at most twice (once by the right pointer `j` and at most once by the left pointer `i`).
   - **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is **O(1)** as we only use a few integer variables for tracking the product and the count, regardless of the input size.

## Key Insights:

- **Sliding Window**:
  - The sliding window technique is key to this solution, allowing us to calculate the product of subarrays efficiently without recomputing from scratch each time.
  
- **Efficient Product Calculation**:
  - By maintaining a running product and adjusting it by moving the left pointer `i`, we ensure that each subarray product is checked in linear time.

- **Handling Edge Cases**:
  - The solution gracefully handles edge cases such as `k == 0`, where no subarray can satisfy the condition.

## Final Thoughts:

This solution efficiently computes the number of contiguous subarrays whose product is less than `k` in **O(n)** time and **O(1)** space. The sliding window approach ensures that we only traverse the list once and adjust the window dynamically as needed, providing an optimal and clean solution.
