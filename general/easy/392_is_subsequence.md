# isSubsequence Solution: Intuition

This solution checks if a string `s` is a subsequence of another string `t`. A subsequence means that all characters of `s` appear in `t` in the same order, but not necessarily consecutively. The approach uses two iterators to traverse both strings and determine if the characters in `s` can be found in order within `t`.

## Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Two pairs of iterators are created: `first1` and `last1` for string `t`, and `first2` and `last2` for string `s`.
   - The iterators `first1` and `first2` point to the beginning of the strings, while `last1` and `last2` point to the end of the strings.

   ```cpp
   auto first1 = t.begin();
   auto last1 = t.end();
   auto first2 = s.begin();
   auto last2 = s.end();
   ```

2. **Iterate Over Both Strings**:
   - The while loop runs until one of the following conditions is met:
     - If the iterator `first2` (for string `s`) reaches the end (`last2`), it means all characters of `s` have been found in `t`, so `true` is returned.
     - If the iterator `first1` (for string `t`) reaches the end (`last1`) and not all characters of `s` have been found, `false` is returned.
   - Inside the loop:
     - If the characters pointed to by `first1` and `first2` are equal, we move the iterator `first2` to the next character in `s`.
     - Regardless of whether a match was found, `first1` is always incremented to continue checking `t`.

   ```cpp
   while(true) {
       if(first2 == last2) 
           return true;
       if(first1 == last1) 
           return false;
       
       if(*first1 == *first2)
           ++first2;
       ++first1;
   }
   ```

3. **Return Result**:
   - If the loop finishes without returning, the function will exit with either `true` (if all characters of `s` were found) or `false` (if `s` is not a subsequence of `t`).

4. **Space and Time Complexity**:
   - **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of string `t`. We iterate over `t` once, and the number of iterations is bounded by the length of `t`.
   - **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is **O(1)**, as we only use a constant amount of extra space (the iterators).

## Key Insights:

- **Two Pointer Technique**:
  - This solution efficiently uses the two-pointer technique (with iterators) to traverse both strings and check if `s` is a subsequence of `t`. It avoids unnecessary rechecking of characters, making the approach efficient.
  
- **Efficient Matching**:
  - The check `if (*first1 == *first2)` ensures that we only advance the pointer in `s` when a matching character is found, thus preserving the order of characters.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The solution uses only iterators, which requires constant extra space, making it very space efficient.

## Final Thoughts:

The solution determines if `s` is a subsequence of `t` in **O(n)** time and **O(1)** space. The use of iterators for the two-pointer approach ensures that the solution is both simple and efficient. The code is elegant and performs well even for larger strings.
