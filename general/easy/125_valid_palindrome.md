# isPalindrome Solution: Intuition

This solution checks whether a given string `s` is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases. It performs several transformations on the string, such as converting it to lowercase and removing non-alphanumeric characters, before checking if the resulting string reads the same forwards and backwards.

## Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Convert to Lowercase**:
   - The solution first converts all characters in the string to lowercase to ensure the comparison is case-insensitive. This is done using `std::transform` and `std::tolower`.

   ```cpp
   std::transform(s.begin(), s.end(), s.begin(), [](auto& c) {
       return static_cast<char>(std::tolower(static_cast<unsigned char>(c)));
   });
   ```

2. **Remove Non-Alphanumeric Characters**:
   - The `std::remove_if` function is used to remove all characters that are not alphanumeric (i.e., not letters or digits). The lambda checks whether each character is not alphanumeric using `std::isalnum`.
   - After removing non-alphanumeric characters, the string is truncated using `erase` to remove the unwanted characters.

   ```cpp
   auto it = std::remove_if(s.begin(), s.end(), [](auto c) {
       return !std::isalnum(static_cast<unsigned char>(c));
   });
   s.erase(it, s.end());
   ```

3. **Check Palindrome**:
   - The string is divided in half, and the first half is compared to the reversed second half. This is achieved by using `std::equal` with the stringâ€™s beginning and the reverse iterator for the second half of the string.
   - The comparison is done only between the alphanumeric characters, as the string has already been transformed.

   ```cpp
   auto half = static_cast<int>(s.size() / 2);
   return std::equal(s.begin(), std::next(s.begin(), half), s.rbegin());
   ```

4. **Return Result**:
   - The function returns `true` if the string is a palindrome and `false` otherwise.

5. **Space and Time Complexity**:
   - **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. The `std::transform`, `std::remove_if`, and `std::equal` functions all run in linear time relative to the size of the string.
   - **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is **O(n)** due to the temporary string created during the transformation (e.g., after removing non-alphanumeric characters).

## Key Insights:

- **Case Insensitivity**:
  - The solution ensures that the palindrome check is case-insensitive by converting the string to lowercase first.
  
- **Efficient Removal of Non-Alphanumeric Characters**:
  - By using `std::remove_if`, the solution efficiently removes all characters that are not alphanumeric, simplifying the palindrome check to just letters and digits.
  
- **String Comparison**:
  - The use of `std::equal` allows a clean and efficient way to check if the first half of the string is equal to the reversed second half.

## Final Thoughts:

The solution efficiently checks if a string is a palindrome while considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring case. It runs in **O(n)** time and uses **O(n)** space, making it both time and space efficient. The use of C++ Standard Library algorithms (`std::transform`, `std::remove_if`, `std::equal`) simplifies the implementation and improves readability. This solution is particularly effective for problems involving string manipulation and comparison.
