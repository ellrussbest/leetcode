# longestCommonPrefix Solution: Intuition

This solution finds the longest common prefix (LCP) shared by a list of strings. The approach starts by assuming the first string is the LCP and then progressively shortens it by comparing it with each subsequent string. If the prefix becomes empty during the comparisons, the algorithm terminates early to avoid unnecessary checks.

## Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   We initialize the result string `res` to the first string in the list. Initially, we assume that the first string is the longest common prefix.

   ```cpp
   std::string res = strs[0];
   ```

2. **Iterate Through the Strings**:
   We iterate through each string `s` in the input vector `strs`. For each string:
   - We check if `res` is a prefix of the current string `s`. This is done using the `starts_with` method.
   - If `res` is not a prefix of `s`, we shorten `res` by removing the last character using `pop_back()`. We continue shortening `res` until it becomes a valid prefix of `s`.
   - **Early Termination**: If at any point `res` becomes an empty string, we immediately return `res`, as there is no common prefix possible.

   ```cpp
   for (const auto& s : strs) {
       while (!s.starts_with(res)) {
           res.pop_back();
           if (res.empty()) return res;
       }
   }
   ```

   - **`starts_with(res)`**: Checks if `s` starts with the string `res`.
   - **`pop_back()`**: Removes the last character of `res` to make it shorter until it matches the prefix of `s`.
   - **Early Termination**: If `res` is empty, it means there's no common prefix left, so we return early.

3. **Return the Result**:
   Once we finish iterating through all the strings, `res` will contain the longest common prefix, which we return as the result.

   ```cpp
   return res;
   ```

## Key Insights:

- **Iterative refinement of the prefix**:
  - We start with the first string as the longest common prefix and progressively shortens it by comparing it with each subsequent string.
  - If `res` is not a valid prefix of a string, we reduce `res` by removing its last character until it becomes a valid prefix for that string.

- **Efficient time complexity**:
  - **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is **O(n * m)**, where `n` is the number of strings and `m` is the average length of the strings. In the worst case, we might need to compare the first string with each character of every other string. However, the early termination optimization can help reduce the actual number of comparisons in some cases.
  - **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the longest string (or the length of the longest common prefix). This is because `res` holds the longest common prefix, which can be as long as the shortest string in the list.

- **Early Termination**:
  - The added check `if (res.empty()) return res;` stops the algorithm early if no common prefix exists, which improves performance for edge cases where the strings have no common prefix or if the prefix becomes empty early on.

## Final Thoughts:

This `longestCommonPrefix` solution is simple and efficient. It starts with the first string as the prefix and progressively refines it by comparing it with each subsequent string. The early termination optimization ensures that the algorithm stops as soon as a common prefix is no longer possible, which helps avoid unnecessary comparisons. The solution works in **O(n * m)** time and uses **O(n)** space, where `n` is the length of the longest common prefix.
