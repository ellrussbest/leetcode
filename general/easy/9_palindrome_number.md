# Palindrome Solution: Intuition

This solution checks if a given signed 32-bit integer `x` is a palindrome, i.e., if it reads the same forwards and backwards. The approach works by reversing the digits of `x` and comparing the reversed number to the original value.

## Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initial Check for Negative Numbers**:
   If `x` is negative, it cannot be a palindrome (because the negative sign would not match on both ends). Therefore, we immediately return `false` for negative values of `x`.

   ```cpp
   if (x < 0) return false;
   ```

   - Negative numbers are inherently non-palindromic because of the sign. 

2. **Prepare for Reversal**:
   We create a copy of `x` called `temp` for extracting digits, and initialize a variable `comp` to store the reversed number.

   ```cpp
   auto temp = x;
   long comp{};
   ```

   - `temp` holds the original number for digit extraction.
   - `comp` starts as 0 and will gradually build the reversed number.

3. **Loop Through Digits**:
   We use a `while` loop to process the digits of `temp`. In each iteration, we extract the last digit of `temp`, append it to `comp`, and then remove the last digit from `temp`.

   ```cpp
   while (temp) {
       int digit = temp % 10;
       comp = comp * 10 + digit;
       temp /= 10;
   }
   ```

   - `digit = temp % 10`: Extracts the last digit.
   - `comp = comp * 10 + digit`: Reverses the number by shifting `comp` and adding the new digit.
   - `temp /= 10`: Removes the last digit from `temp`.

4. **Compare Reversed Number**:
   Once the loop completes, `comp` holds the reversed version of `x`. We then compare `comp` to `x` to determine if they are equal.

   ```cpp
   return comp == x;
   ```

   - If the reversed number `comp` matches the original number `x`, the function returns `true`, indicating that `x` is a palindrome.
   - Otherwise, it returns `false`.

## Key Insights:

- **Negative Numbers**: 
  The function handles negative numbers early on by returning `false`, as negative numbers cannot be palindromes due to the negative sign.

- **Efficient Reversal**: 
  The function reverses the number digit by digit and compares it to the original value, avoiding the need for any additional space like arrays or lists.

- **Edge Case Handling**:
  The function handles edge cases like `0` (which is a palindrome) and single-digit numbers, which are always palindromes.

- **Constant Space**:
  The solution uses **O(1)** space, as it only stores the reversed number (`comp`) and a temporary variable (`temp`) for digit extraction.

## Final Thoughts:

This solution efficiently checks whether a 32-bit signed integer is a palindrome by reversing its digits and comparing them. The function works for both positive and negative numbers and handles edge cases, providing an elegant and efficient check with constant space complexity.
